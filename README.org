* Emacs Presentation for DevICT

This repository contains the presentation I am going to present to [[http://devict.org/][DevICT]] on
March 26th, 2015.

It is written in org-mode and designed to be run through org-present.  It can
also be exported to PDF or reveal.js with decent success.

Once this talk has been recorded, I will update this README with a link to the
video.
